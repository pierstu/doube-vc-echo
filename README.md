# Double vc-echo
Scott Bernardi's famous [VC Echo](http://www.bernacomp.com/elec/og2/og3_echo.html) ported to Eurorack. 

Idea from [the excellent Elektrophon repo](https://github.com/spielhuus/elektrophon/tree/master/modules/echo) but it's THT and actually uses a 3080, which is pretty expensive in my area
- Don't expect any form of serious V/oct tracking, feel free to send a pull request if you see anything weird (just started learning cad few months ago) 
- Must be skiff fiendly. SMT 0805 but the 2399, which i have 3 in dip lying around for years
- Planning to use a 13700 instead of a 3080
